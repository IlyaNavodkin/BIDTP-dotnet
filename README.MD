# Questions and answers

### Ask:

-   Why should I split my application into client and server?

### Answer:

-   Separate testing and debugging of applications. It's easier to abstract yourself
-   Independence from stack and technologies
-   Separate process, domain for each application. If your application works as a plugin, then this solves the problem of dependency conflicts (Addin Autodesk Revit)
-   Separation of areas of responsibility for application development - if it is developed in a team

### Ask:

-   Why should I use this protocol if I can use web protocols?

### Answer:

-   This protocol is intended for local tasks of interaction between two processes. If you use web protocols for such tasks, you may encounter unexpected problems on the client side. For example - the clientâ€™s port is closed or there is a problem with the network

### Ask:

-   It's too complicated, I'll have to write a lot of code to interact with the business logic. It's easier to call a service or method directly within one process

### Answer:

-   The protocol is provided with the entire infrastructure with features that allow not only to minimize the cost of writing code for interaction, but also provide general functionality - necessary for creating modern applications - on the client and server sides

# Philosophy and goals

The main issues addressed by this protocol include facilitating simple interaction between two processes. This enables independent and implicit communication between applications, regardless of the technologies used in their development.

The same effect can be achieved by using web protocols such as WebSocket, TCP, UDP, HTTP, and others. However, their obvious downside is that for their correct operation, it is necessary to ensure that the required ports are open on the local machine of the client or server and there are no issues with the network infrastructure.

In the current approach, data exchange between processes occurs at a lower level (byte-to-byte).

# Structure of BIDTP protocol

Below are listed the main components along with their general descriptions.

## Interaction scheme

[Common interaction diagram](https://github.com/IlyaNavodkin/BIDTP-dotnet/blob/master/Common/images/BIDTP-dotnet-arch-schema-1.png)

The BIDTP protocol is based on client-server interaction. Communication between the components occurs using messages in a byte stream (pipe stream). The messages consist of Request\Response objects.

## Requirements of data types

Below are listed the main data types:

| Data type      | Size (bytes) |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| int (32 bit)   | 4            |
| char (unicode) | 2            |

## Requirements to request

The request object has the following structure:

| Field name     | Type             | Size (bytes) |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| MessageLength  | int              | 4            |
| MessageType    | enum (int )      | 4            |
| HeadersLength  | int              | 4            |
| HeadersContent | string (unicode) | var          |
| BodyLength     | int              | 4            |
| BodyContent    | string (unicode) | var          |

## Requirements to response

The response object has the following structure:

| Field name     | Type             | Size (bytes) |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| MessageLength  | int              | 4            |
| MessageType    | enum (int )      | 4            |
| StatusCode     | enum (int )      | 4            |
| HeadersLength  | int              | 4            |
| HeadersContent | string (unicode) | var          |
| BodyLength     | int              | 4            |
| BodyContent    | string (unicode) | var          |

## Status code

The status code is a specific code (classification) of responses from the server according to this protocol. The main status codes and their descriptions are provided below:

| Code         | Description                                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Success      | 100 - Successful response from the server                         |
| ClientError  | 200 - Not successful Server response - error on client side       |
| Unauthorized | 201 - Not successful Server response - client is not unauthorized |
| NotFound     | 202 - Not successful Server response - route not found            |
| ServerError  | 300 - Not successful Server response - error on server side       |

## Request class

The Request class allows you to conveniently retrieve and store information not only in the form of primitive data types but also as complex objects. Additionally, you can include the required information as headers to provide necessary additional details to your Request. Moreover, you can use it to define routes.

```c#
# Create request class
var requestClass = new Request();

# Add custom headers
requestClass.Headers.Add("Authorizartion", "token");

# Set route
requestClass.SetRoute("AnyRouteOfUrServer");

# Set body like a object
requestClass.SetBody<AdditionalData>(additionalData);

# or

# Set body like a string
requestClass.SetBody<string>("Any string");

# Get body like a object
AdditionalData dto = requestClass.GetBody<AdditionalData>();

# or

# Get body like a string
string stringJsonDto = requestClass.GetBody<string>();
```

## Response class

The Response class allows you to conveniently retrieve and write information not only in the form of primitive data types but also in the form of complex objects. Additionally, you can write the required information as headers to provide necessary additional details to your Response. It is also essential to specify the response status code.

```c#
# Create response class and set StatusCode
var responseClass = new Response(StatusCode.Success);

responseClass.Headers.Add("AnyHeader", "AnyValue");

# Set body like a object
responseClass.SetBody<AdditionalData>(additionalData);

# or

# Set body like a string
responseClass.SetBody<string>("Any string");

# Get body like a object
AdditionalData dto = responseClass.GetBody<AdditionalData>();

# or

# Get body like a string
string stringJsonDto = responseClass.GetBody<string>();
```

# Server connection

The main task of implementing the server was to create the fundamental infrastructure for easy server management and handling of its dependencies.

It was also important to provide developers with the freedom to implement business tasks for applications, ranging from creating their own authentication/authorization schemes to data exchange schemas.

Setting up and connecting a server using the BIDTP protocol is very simple!

```c#
# Create builder
var builder = new ServerBuilder();

# Create and set generic options
var options = new ServerOptions("*", "testpipe" ... );
builder.SetGeneralOptions(options);

# U can use any DI container
var serviceCollection = new ServiceCollection();

# Add providers in DI container
builder.ServiceCollection.AddLogging(l => l.AddConsole().SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Information));

var serviceProvider = serviceCollection.BuildServiceProvider();

# Add custom DI container
builder.AddDiContainer(serviceProvider);

# Add route and handle this
builder.AddRoute("route", HandleThisRoute);

# Build it!
var server = builder.Build();
```

## DI container

The server has a DI (Dependency Injection) container for convenient use of providers and services. You can connect your providers to the container:

```c#
# Your logger provider
builder.ServiceCollection.AddLogging(l => l.AddConsole().SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Information));

# Your AuthProvider
builder.ServiceCollection.AddTransient<AuthProvider>();

# Your ColorProvider
builder.ServiceCollection.AddScoped<ColorProvider>();

# Your Repository
builder.ServiceCollection.AddSingleton<ElementRepository>();

```

U can use ur custom DI container, implemet IServiceProvider and do it!

## Flexible routing system

The server also features a flexible routing system. You can use different combinations to achieve your goals for implementing the business logic of the application. See below for the main features.

### Handlers chain

You can create chains of **Func<Context, Task>** handlers (ur custom local function, handlers, methods) to process different routes, which will be executed sequentially:

```c#
# Add for "PrintMessage" route many handlers\middlewares\guards
builder.AddRoute("PrintMessage", JustChickenGuard, MessageController.PrintMessageHandler);

# Add for "GetElements" route controller method
builder.AddRoute("GetElements", MessageController.GetElements);

# Local handler or middleware or guard
Task JustChickenGuard(Context context)
{
    # Get the client Request
    var request = context.Request;

    var isShitWord = request.Body.Contains("Yes of course");

    if(isShitWord)
    {
        var dto = new Error
        {
            Message = "I am Alexandr Nevsky",
            Description = "Exception: Chicken-Bodybuilder detected",
            ErrorCode = 228
        };

        var response = new Response(StatusCode.ClientError);

        response.SetBody(dto);

        context.Response = response;
    }

    return Task.CompletedTask;
}
```

Exactly - you can use your custom middleware\guards to effectively manage the lifecycle of messages, providing flexibility and efficiency. All you need to do is utilize the Context as a parameter in your method.

### Custom attributes

You can create custom attributes that you can use to create Guard or Middleware components that will execute BEFORE the method. Implement **IMethodScopedPreInvokable** for ur attribute.

```c#
# Create custom attribute and implement IMethodScopedPreInvokable interface
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Method, Inherited = true, AllowMultiple = false)]
public class AuthGuardAttribute : Attribute, IMethodScopedPreInvokable
{
    public Task Invoke(Context context)
    {
        var request = context.Request;

        request.Headers.TryGetValue("UserId", out var userIdString);

        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(userIdString))
        {
            var dto = new Error
            {
                Message = "Not authorized",
                Description = "Not authorized ",
                ErrorCode = 403
            };

            var response = new Response(StatusCode.Unauthorized)
            {
                Body = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(dto)
            };

            context.Response = response;
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

For example, you can implement protection for your data or some logic based on the attribute's input data.

```c#
# Add custom attribute to method
public class SendMessageController
{
    [AuthGuard]
    [RoleGuard("admin")]
    public static Task GetMessageForAdmin(Context context)
    {
        var request = context.Request;

        if (request.Body.Equals("internal error")) throw new Exception("Mock error");

        context.Response = new Response(StatusCode.Success)
        {
            Body = "{ \"Response\": \"" + "Hello admin" + "\" }"
        };

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    [AuthGuard]
    [RoleGuard("user")]
    public static Task GetMessageForUser(Context context)
    {
        context.Response = new Response(StatusCode.Success)
        {
            Body = "{ \"Response\": \"" + "Hello user" + "\" }"
        };

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    [AuthGuard]
    public static Task GetAuthAccessResponse(Context context)
    {
        context.Response = new Response(StatusCode.Success)
        {
            Body = "{ \"Response\": \"" + "Auth access" + "\" }"
        };

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }

    public static Task GetFreeAccessResponse(Context context)
    {
        context.Response = new Response(StatusCode.Success)
        {
            Body = "{ \"Response\": \"" + "Free access" + "\" }"
        };

        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}

```

## ObjectContainer

You can use the ObjectContainer property in the Context class. ObjectContainer allows you to embed objects or additional information into it so that, during the Request lifecycle in the server's routing system, you can access them in any Func<Context, Task> or IMethodScopedPreInvokable in the routing chain.

For example, you can store authentication data, map data, collect and record metrics, and more there.

```c#
# First handler
public static Task Handle(Context context)
{
    var request = context.Request;

    var additionalData = request.GetBody<AdditionalData>();

    # Add object to container
    context.ObjectContainer.AddObject<AdditionalData>(additionalData);

    return Task.CompletedTask;
}

# Second handler
public static Task GetMappedObjectWithMetadataFromObjectContainer(Context context)
{
    var objectContainer = context.ObjectContainer;

    # Try get it from container
    var additionalData = objectContainer.GetObject<AdditionalData>();

    if (additionalData is null) throw new Exception("No object in object container");

    var response = new Response(StatusCode.Success);

    response.SetBody(additionalData);

    context.Response = response;

    return Task.CompletedTask;
}

```

## Background services

If you need the server to utilize the functionality of background services (workers) that will operate asynchronously, you can make use of adding custom components and connect them to the server:

```c#
# Set custom name for services
server.AddBackgroundService<LoggingWorker>("BackgroundWorker1");
server.AddBackgroundService<LoggingWorker>("BackgroundWorker2");

or

# Or leave it to the server
server.AddBackgroundService<LoggingWorker>();
```

## Write\read events

You can use your data transfer events (write and read) to use this information to more accurately display progress of server:

```c#
# Read event
App.Server.ReadProgress += OnProgress;

# Write event
App.Server.WriteProgress += OnProgress;

# Handle!
private void OnProgress(object? sender, ProgressEventArgs e)
{
    var bytesWritten = e.BytesWritten;
    var totalBytes = e.TotalBytes;
    var progressPercentage = (int)((double)bytesWritten / totalBytes * 100);

    if (totalBytes == bytesWritten)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Completed");
    }
    else if (progressPercentage >= 0 && progressPercentage <= 100)
    {
        var message = $"{e.ProgressOperationType.ToString()} progress: {progressPercentage}%";
        Console.WriteLine(message);
    }
}
```

# Client connection

For connecting a client to the server, you need to create a settings class, instantiate a BIDTP client, and establish a connection to the server:

```c#
# Simple WPF app
public partial class App
{
    # Or set in DI\Singleton\other place
    public static Client? Client;

    protected override void OnStartup(StartupEventArgs e)
    {
        # Create options
        var options = new ClientOptions("*", "testpipe" ...);

        # Create client
        Client = new Client(options);
    }
}
```

For sending messages, you can create a class (Request) and send it, then wait to receive a response from it (Response):

```c#

private async void GetElements(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    try
    {
        var mainWindow = (MainWindow)Application.Current.MainWindow;
        var token = mainWindow.AuthTokenTextBox.Text;

        # Create Request object
        var request = new Request();

        # Add custom header
        request.Headers.Add("Authorization", token);

        # Set route
        request.SetRoute("GetElements");

        var getCategoryRequest = new GetElementsByCategoryRequest
        {
            Category = CategoryTextBox.Text
        };

        # Set dto to json string body
        request.SetBody<GetElementsByCategoryRequest>(getCategoryRequest);

        # Send Request to server
        var response = await App.Client.WriteRequestAsync(request);

        # Check status code from server
        if (response.StatusCode == StatusCode.Success)
        {
            # Get dto from body
            var elements = response.GetBody<List<ElementDto>>();

            # Add Elements to ur UI
            DataGridElements.ItemsSource = elements;
        }
        # If u have invalid status code
        else
        {
            # Get error dto
            var error = response.GetBody<Error>();

            # Handle it!
            MessageBox.Show($"Message: {error.Message} " +
                            $"\nError code: {error.ErrorCode}\nDescription: {error.Description}");
        }
    }
    catch (Exception exception)
    {
        MessageBox.Show(exception.Message);
    }
}

```

## Write\read events

You can use your data transfer events (write and read) to use this information to more accurately display progress of client:

```c#
# Read event
App.Client.ReadProgress += OnProgress;

# Write event
App.Client.WriteProgress += OnProgress;

# Handle it!
private async void OnProgress(object? sender, ProgressEventArgs e)
{
    var bytesWritten = e.BytesWritten;
    var totalBytes = e.TotalBytes;
    var progressPercentage = (int)((double)bytesWritten / totalBytes * 100);

    if (progressPercentage % 5 != 0) return;

    var message = $"{e.ProgressOperationType.ToString()} progress: {progressPercentage}%";

    Debug.WriteLine(message);

    await Dispatcher.InvokeAsync(() =>
    {
        if (totalBytes == bytesWritten)
        {
            ProgressBarTextBlock.Text = "Completed";
            ProgressBar.Value = 0;
        }
        else if (progressPercentage >= 0 && progressPercentage <= 100)
        {
            ProgressBarTextBlock.Text = message;
            ProgressBar.Value = progressPercentage;
        }
    }, System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherPriority.Background);
});

```

## Health-checking

The client implements logic for checking the connection to the server - to obtain more up-to-date information about its status:

```c#
App.Client.IsLifeCheckConnectedChanged += (s, e) =>
{
    Dispatcher.InvokeAsync(() =>
    {
        if (e)
        {
            EllipseStatusCircle.Fill = Brushes.Green;
            ConnectToServerButton.Content = "Disconnect";
            ServerStatusTextBlock.Text = "Server connected";
        }
        else
        {
            EllipseStatusCircle.Fill = Brushes.Red;
            ConnectToServerButton.Content = "Connect";
            ServerStatusTextBlock.Text = "Server not connected";

        }
    });
};

# Can u connect or not?
var canConnect = App.Client.IsConnectionStarting;

# U connected?
var isConnected = App.Client.IsHealthCheckConnected;

```
